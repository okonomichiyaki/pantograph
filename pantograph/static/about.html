            <h2>what data is stored or collected?</h2>
            <p>
                The software does not use any cookies, and does not collect or store anything other than temporary data.
                When you create a room, some data is stored to enable connecting to your opponent,
                but this data is deleted after a room is inactive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The streaming video is coordinated through a
                <a href="https://www.metered.ca/">third party API</a>
                and will usually be sent between browsers using a peer-to-peer protocol,
                but in some network configurations may pass through their servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image used for card identification (a 300 pixel square portion of the video)
                is sent to Google's Cloud Vision API.

            <h2>why is it called Pantograph?</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30023">Pantograph</a> is TƒÅo Salonga's console, and TƒÅo's subtitle is
                <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30019">"telepresence magician"</a>. It's an indirect nod to the
                <a href="https://spelltable.wizards.com/">app</a> that inspired it.
