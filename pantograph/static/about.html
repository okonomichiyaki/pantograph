            <h2>what is this?</h2>
            <p>
                Pantograph is a web application that streamlines playing the card game
                <a href="https://nullsignal.games/about/netrunner/">Netrunner</a>
                with a remote opponent using physical cards.
                Each player needs paper cards and a camera positioned over their play area.
                Once you start a video call using the app you can click on your opponent's cards to see higher resolution images.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can try it out <a href="/app/demo">here</a>.
                This demo uses static video files to simulate a game in progress,
                and you can click on the video to see the card search in action.
                Refresh the page to generate a random runner and corp match up.
            </p>

            <h2>how does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                When you click on the video a cropped snapshot is sent to the server and optical character recognition
                (via Google's Cloud Vision API) is used to try to match the title of the card with data from
                <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/">NetrunnerDB</a>.
                The search is based on recognized text, not image recognition based on the art,
                so should work with alt arts so long as they include the title and do not use a very unusual layout.
            </p>

            <h2>why is it called Pantograph?</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30023">Pantograph</a> is TƒÅo Salonga's console, and TƒÅo's subtitle is
                <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30019">"telepresence magician"</a>. It's an indirect nod to the
                <a href="https://spelltable.wizards.com/">app</a> that inspired it. The logo is a reference to a certain
                <a href="https://slay-the-spire.fandom.com/wiki/Pantograph">video game</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>what data is stored or collected?</h2>
            <p>
                The software does not use any cookies, and does not collect or store anything other than temporary data.
                When you create a room, some data is stored to enable connecting to your opponent,
                but this data is deleted after a room is inactive.
            </p>
            <p>
                The streaming video is coordinated through a
                <a href="https://www.metered.ca/">third party API</a>
                and will usually be sent between browsers using a peer-to-peer protocol,
                but in some network configurations may pass through their servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image used for card identification (a 300 pixel square portion of the video)
                is sent to Google's Cloud Vision API.
