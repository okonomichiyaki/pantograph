                <h2>how does it work?</h2>
                <p>
                    When you click on your opponent's video feed, an image is captured and sent to the backend,
                    where optical character recognition and fuzzy text search are used to find the title of the card.
                </p>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em">
                    (no image recognition is involved.
                    if you are proficient in computer vision or machine learning
                    and are interested in collaborating, please get in touch!)
                </p>

                <h2>why won't it recognize cards?</h2>
                <p>
                    You need a camera capable of capturing at least 720p video with an overhead shot of your play area.
                    The best way to improve the accuracy is to play in a well lit space with indirect lighting.
                    Direct light and glare that washes out the text on cards will hinder recognition.
                    Matte card sleeves may work better than glossy sleeves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you haven't already, be sure click the "calibrate" button and drag select a rectangle on your opponent's screen around any card. You should repeat this process in a new room or if your opponent's video changes (zooms in/out or moves closer/farther away from the table).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are playing Standard, you must create the room with that setting, otherwise only Startup cards will be searched for.
                    Players should join as the side they are playing, and either create a new room, or leave and rejoin to switch sides if you play a second game.
                    (this improves identification by narrowing the search space)
                    Both FFG and NSG cards are supported, but alt arts with unusual templating may not work.
                </p>

                <h2>what data is stored or collected?</h2>
                <p>
                    The software does not use any cookies, and does not collect or store anything other than temporary data.
                    When you create a room, some data is stored to enable connecting to your opponent,
                    but this data is deleted after a room is inactive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The streaming video is coordinated through a
                    <a href="https://www.metered.ca/">third party API</a>
                    and will usually be sent between browsers using a peer-to-peer protocol,
                    but in some network configurations may pass through their servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The image used for card identification (a 300 pixel square portion of the video)
                    is sent to Google's Cloud Vision API.
                </p>

                <h2>why is it called Pantograph?</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30023">Pantograph</a> is
                    <a href="https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/30019">TƒÅo Salonga</a>'s console,
                    and TƒÅo's subtitle is "telepresence magician". It's an indirect nod to the
                    <a href="https://spelltable.wizards.com/">app</a> that inspired it.
